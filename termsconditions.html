 <strong>1.CONTENT</strong>
It is important that you understand your rights and responsibilities with regard to the content on our Services, including any content you provide or post. You are expressly prohibited from posting inappropriate content.
While using our Services, you will have access to: (I) content that you upload or provide while using our Services, even if suggested by our Services ("Your Content"); (ii) content that other users upload or provide while using our Services ("USER CONTENT"); and (iii) content that HyU provides on and through our Services ("Our Content"). In this agreement, "content" includes, without limitation, all text, images, video, audio, or other material on our Services, including information on users' profiles and in direct messages between users. 
<br/><strong>3a. YOUR CONTENT</strong>
You are responsible for Your Content. Don't share anything that you wouldn't want others to see, that would violate this Agreement, or that may expose you or us to legal liability.
You are solely responsible and liable for Your Content, and, therefore, you agree to indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content.
You represent and warrant to us that the information you provide to us or any other user is accurate, including any information submitted through google or other third-party sources (if applicable), and that you will update your account information as necessary to ensure its accuracy.
The content included on your individual profile should be relevant to the intended use of our Services. You may not display any personal contact, banking information, or peer-to-peer payment information, whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card, peer-to-peer payment user name, or other banking details). If you choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, you do so at your own risk. We strongly encourage you to use caution in disclosing any personal information online.
Your individual profile will be visible to other people around the world, so be sure that you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. You acknowledge and agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users, and, notwithstanding these Terms, other users may share Your Content with third parties.

While you will have access to USER CONTENT, it is not yours and you may not copy or use USER CONTENT for any purpose except as contemplated by these Terms.
Other users will also share content on our Services. USER CONTENT belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed at the direction of that user.
You should always carefully review and independently verify USER CONTENT for accuracy. Other users may use tools to generate or enhance content based on the USER CONTENT they provide.  USER CONTENT may include biased, incorrect, harmful, offensive, or misleading information. Other users are responsible for their USER CONTENT, as well as any and all decisions made, actions taken, and failures to take action based on their use of USER CONTENT. 
You do not have any rights in relation to USER CONTENT, and, unless expressly authorized by HyU, you may only use USER CONTENT to the extent that your use is consistent with our Services' purpose of allowing us to communicate with and meet one another.
